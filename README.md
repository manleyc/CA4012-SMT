### Lab 3

  1.  Write a program to compute word n-grams (up to 4-grams) of a given input sentence.
  
  2.  Write a program to evaluate a translation output (sentence) against a reference translation
      (sentence) in BLEU score. The input to your program should be two sentences, the first
      representing the translation to be scored and the second representing the gold standard reference
      translation (i.e. your target language test file). The output to your program should be a score (float).
      
  3.  Try to adapt your program from Q2 in order to evaluate the translation output comparing to
      multiple references.
